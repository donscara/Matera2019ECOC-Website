            <p>The cathedral was built in Apulian Romanesque style in the 13th century on the ridge that forms the highest point of the city of Matera and divides the two Sassi, on the site of the ancient Church of Saint Eustace, protector of the city. Construction began in 1203, the year in which Pope Innocent III raised Matera to the rank of an archdiocese in union with Acerenza as the Archdiocese of Acerenza and Matera, and was completed in 1270.</p>

            <p>The Sassi and the Park of the Rupestrian Churches of Matera comprises a complex of houses, churches, monasteries and hermitages built into the natural caves of the Murgia. Covering an area of 1,016 ha this remarkable and intact troglodyte settlement contains more than a thousand dwellings and a large number of shops and workshops. The property was first occupied during the Palaeolithic period and shows evidence of continuous human occupation through several millennia until the present day, and is harmoniously integrated into the natural terrain and ecosystem. </p>

            <h2>Castello Tramontano</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "attractionDescription">
            <p> Situated on a hill near the town centre, this 15th-century castle was left unfinished after the unpopular Count Tramontano, seemingly unaware that high taxes and his habit of bedding every new bride on her wedding night wasn't winning much favour, was killed by rebellious subjects. Four small tiles on Via Riscatto to the left of the cathedral paint a tale of the count's violent death. </p>

        <div class = "attractionDescription">
            <p> Along with the many well-known wonders of the city (rock churches, settlement in the Sassi, cisterns), a unique and different charm takes on the hypogean city which allows you to visit part of what is defined as “an extraordinary schedule of layering settlements, which start in very remote ages.”  Excavated places in the rock, ancient houses with openings to light and let the air come in, in which we can imagine the daily life of the “hypogean civilization”. A fascinating journey into space and time that will take you to the under belly of Matera one of the oldest cities in the world. </p>
