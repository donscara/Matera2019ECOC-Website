# Matera2019ECOC-Website
Matera 2019 European Capital of Culture Website

I have decided to create a site that is a sort of a magazine and dinamically updated newsletter of 2019 Matera's events and initiatives.
Matera is my hometown and this year is the European Capital of Culture with daily events and attractions planned all over the city.
I wanted to create a site with maps and multimedia that allow the user to explore not only the geography of the city and plan ahead their visit but also to experience visually the multiple facets of the events and attractions via video, social media and photos.

Home page: is the main portal and provide links to the other pages a brief description of the site and a dynamic tweet feed with the latest news from the official site of the event.
 
Events page: The page where you can navigate the programme of the event, you will find the main highlights from the programme in the main body of the page and on the side you will find a widget with the monthly events and the twitter feed of the events' page with the latest news.
 
Events Map Page: A full map of the locations and venue where the events take place and the highlights of the top venues where the events take place.
 
Attractions Map Page: Aside from the Cultural Events visitors want to know the main attractions of the city, here another map using Gooogle Maps API to explore the main attractions of the city with major attractions described.
 
Media Page: A media gallery page containing a Youtube dynamic API video playlist and a Javascript Picture Slideshow/carousel, together with an Instagram API widget updated dynamically and the official site Facebook page widget with the latest updates.
