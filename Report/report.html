Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.
 
I have decided to create a site that is a sort of a magazine and dinamically updated newsletter of 2019 Matera's events and initiatives.
Matera is my hometown and this year is the European Capital of Culture with daily events and attractions planned all over the city.
I wanted to create a site with maps and multimedia that allow the user to explore not only the geography of the city and plan ahead their visit but also to experience visually the multiple facets of the events and attractions via video, social media and photos.
I have created a structure similar to the South London Online Reading Site but integrating the opendata content available on the offical site: https://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/en/ and used a new wireframe to adapt the structure of the site to the content and purpouse.
 
Home page: is the main portal and provide links to the other pages a brief description of the site and a dynamic tweet feed with the latest news from the official site of the event.
 
Events page: The page where you can navigate the programme of the event, you will find the main highlights from the programme in the main body of the page and on the side you will find a widget with the monthly events and the twitter feed of the events' page with the latest news.
 
Events Map Page: A full map of the locations and venue where the events take place and the highlights of the top venues where the events take place.
 
Attractions Map Page: Aside from the Cultural Events visitors want to know the main attractions of the city, here another map using Gooogle Maps API to explore the main attractions of the city with major attractions described.
 
Media Page: A media gallery page containing a Youtube dynamic API video playlist and a Javascript Picture Slideshow/carousel, together with an Instagram API widget updated dynamically and the official site Facebook page widget with the latest updates.
 
State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include
guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.
 
•	The main source of inspiration is the website: https://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/en/ graphically elegant and dynamically visual. The content and information is following the concept of the Programme which is Open Future, all the information is creative common and shared with everyone willing to use it.
•	The second inspiration are the travel blog of which I am passionate and I developed the site also based on my personal blog that is publicly published and with almost 500000 visits so far.
•	The third inspiration is the love for my unique hometown and the desire to contribute in this special year for my city.
 
State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.
 
•	I have used a responsive design and the site resize responsively on multiple devices (mobile/tablets/desktop) to adapt accordingly to need and zoom necessity.
•	I have used a large font to facilitate reading and tried to maximize screen estate
•	I have used consistent color palette to avoid sharp contrasts and maintain a soft and balanced viewing experience.
 
State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.
 
•	I wanted something that is simple and of intuitive immediate use without too much cluttering. Something that can be used by the widest public possible in order to spread the message as widely as possible. 
•	I have also tried and replicate the colors of my city looking for a color palette based on stone/rock and with some dark blue overtone to match the street effect of walking in the city and the color overtone you experience in the real context.
•	I emphasized also dynamic content and social media live updates since these are the tools used to organize many of the collective events that take place in the city during the year and therefore established a link with the programme.
 
State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).
 
•	I had never used API mapping tools such Openstreetmap. I have used API and data connections but also layers and Google Maps Integrations with allowed me to create the 2 interactive and dynamic maps in the Events Map Page and Attractions Map Page respectively. I did extensive research on both sites and Stackoverflow.com to learn how to use them.
•	I have also learned in W3schools.com how to use images in a website and how to integrate Javascript code in my site to create a slideshow/carousel.
•	The other important skill I learned is how to work with Youtube and videos in general to embed them in my site, I also managed to find out studying the developer websites of Google and Youtube how to integrate playlists.
 
What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?
 
I am particularly satisfied of my data integrations in Maps and Videos, it was something new for me and I think the results are very satisfying.
 
What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
another time?
 
I would like to extend my image manipulation skills adding transparencies, effects and other advanced techniques to bring the site at an higher level of sophistication.
 
What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.
 
I used W3schools.com as a general reference and used also Google, Youtube, Instagram, Facebook developers sites to learn how to integrate, use API and connect to datasources. 
I used also Openstreetmap.

Taking things from the web
 
You can use almost anything you like that you can find on the Web, but you should avoid
anything that is not open (e.g. that costs money or requires login or registration), or
anything from sites belonging to commercial companies. Being able to re-use other people's
ideas is an important web skill. However, it is essential that, on your report page, you
describe what you have taken, where you took it from, and what you have done to it. If you
copy-and-paste something almost without change, you must say that you have done it, it
must conform to the standards, and you shouldn't expect many marks for it, except for how
you have made it fit in with and enhance your own design. To get more marks you can use
code from elsewhere, document the source of the code in your report.html and then edit it
in some way. Showing you can adapt existing code will earn you more marks. In order to be
clear which material you have written and which you have used from elsewhere you will be
expected to provide comprehensive comments within your HTML, CSS and Javascript files
indicating code you have used, code you have adopted and edited and code that you have
written.
